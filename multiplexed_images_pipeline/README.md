# Data preprocessing of multiplexed imaging data (Python)
This pipeline is used for data preprocessing and visualization for multiplexed imaging data, which could be perfectly adapted for scanpy and SOAPy.  
## Cell segmentation using DeepCell - Mesmer
To run Mesmer in docker, please refer to https://deepcell.readthedocs.io/en/master/.  
```

```

## Expression quantification, cell type classification and in-situ visualization
Raw multiplexed `.tiff` file and segmentation result `_mask.tiff` are used as input. The codes are in `.ipynb`.

## Data generation of different plaforms
### IMC (Imaging mass cytometry)
