### Data preprocessing of multiplexed images data
---
This pipeline is used for data preprocessing and visualization for multiplexed data, which could be perfectly adapted with scanpy and SOAPy.  
#### Cell segmentation using DeepCell - Mesmer
Running Mesmer in docker, please refer to https://deepcell.readthedocs.io/en/master/.  


#### Expression quantification, cell type classification and in-situ visualization
Please refer to `.ipynb`

#### Citation
SOAPy: a Python package to dissect spatial architecture, dynamics and communication
