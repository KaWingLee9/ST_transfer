Sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of estimation errors in the decomposition results on immune subtype clustering
To evaluate the impact of estimation errors in the decomposition results on the subtypes clustering, we have run additional computational experiments to assess the robustness of the clustering results. Specifically, we perturbed the cell-type fraction estimates and proteomic-based pathway scores by adding independent Gaussian noises with varying standard deviations (5%, 10% and 20% of the original standard deviation). We then evaluated how the clustering results might change based on the perturbed data matrices. This experiment was repeated 100 times. The Rand index between the original immune subtypes and the clusters derived from perturbed data matrices were above 0.87 with a median above 0.9 for all the SD levels, which indicates that the detected immune subtypes are rather robust to the variability in the cell-type fraction estimates.
